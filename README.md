# Project Name
React Gallery 

## Description
This project took three days to develop.

I wanted to create an app where a user would be able to see a list of pictures coming from a database. The user could like, or delete those photos.

I was looking to use react in order to build interactive components with multiple functionalities. I also wanted to experiment with basic material-UI concepts.

### Prerequisites

- Node
- React
- Javascript
- Axios
- Material UI


## Installation

1. Create a database named `react_gallery`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. I recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage

1. A user is able to browse the presented pictures, or add a photo oftheir own from a local file
2. The user is able to click the delete button to delete a photo from the database
3. Clicking the like button will show a new like under the picture

## Built With

- Node
- React
- Javascript
- Axios
- Material UI
